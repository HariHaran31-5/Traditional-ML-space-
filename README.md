# Unified ML Suite: A Modular Machine Learning Framework

# Unified ML Suite  

### Overview  
Unified ML Suite is a modular machine learning framework designed for flexibility and ease of use. This project consolidates popular machine learning techniques across Classification, Regression, Clustering, and Deep Learning, with a streamlined interface accessible via Streamlit.

### Features  
- **Classification Models**: Implemented popular algorithms like Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks.  
- **Regression Models**: Includes Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Ridge Regression, and advanced models like Gradient Boosting.  
- **Clustering**: Supports K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN, and Gaussian Mixture Models.  
- **Deep Learning**: Implementations of CNNs, RNNs, and Transfer Learning using frameworks like TensorFlow/Keras.  
- **Streamlit UI**: Simplified interface for interacting with the models, uploading datasets, and visualizing results.  

## How to Use
- Select the type of model (Classification, Regression, Clustering, or Deep Learning) from the Streamlit UI.
